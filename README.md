# statistical-simulation-coupon-collectors-problem

## Project Overview

The Coupon Collector's Problem (CCP) is a classic problem in probability theory and statistics that models the process of collecting distinct items randomly. Given a total of $\( n \)$ unique coupons, we ask: how many draws are needed, on average, to collect all $\( n \)$ coupons at least once?

### Mathematical Foundation

Let $\( T \)$ be the number of trials required to collect all $\( n \)$ coupons. We decompose $\( T \)$ into $\( n \)$ distinct phases:

- **Phase 1**: Collecting the first coupon (1 draw needed).
- **Phase 2**: Collecting the second distinct coupon.
- **Phase $\( k \)$**: Collecting a coupon that is different from the previous $\( k-1 \)$ coupons.

The number of draws required in each phase follows a geometric distribution. Given that $\( k-1 \)$ distinct coupons have already been collected, the probability of drawing a new coupon is $\( \frac{n - (k-1)}{n} \)$. The expected number of draws required to collect a new coupon in phase $\( k \)$ is given by:

$$E[T_k] = \frac{n}{n - (k-1)}$$

By summing over all $\( n \)$ phases, the expected total number of draws is:

$$E[T] = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{n}{n - (k-1)}$$

This simplifies to:

$$E[T] = n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k}$$

where $\( H_n \)$ is the harmonic number:

$$H_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k}$$

Thus, the expected number of draws is:

$$E[T] = n H_n \approx n (\ln n + \gamma) + \frac{1}{2}$$

where $\( \gamma \approx 0.57721 \)$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

The variance of $\( T \)$ is given by:

$$\text{Var}(T) = n^2 \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k^2}$$

For large $\( n \)$, the standard deviation is approximately:

$$\sigma_T \approx n \pi^2 / 6$$

This simulation empirically verifies these theoretical results and extends them through Monte Carlo estimation and Markov chain modeling.
